## Project Title

Argus: The Crowdsourced Lost & Found Platform

## Project Description    

Argus is a crowdsourced lost & found platform that allows users to report lost belongings or share items they’ve found all through a single, centralized system. It eliminates the problem of scattered and unorganized lost & found information by providing a structured, community-driven solution.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
On our college campus, items are lost and found almost every day. Currently, students rely on WhatsApp groups to share updates , a method that’s often messy, unorganized, and easy to miss. This inspired me to build a centralized platform where all lost and found information is stored in a structured and searchable way.
The goal is to make it the go-to solution for students to quickly report, track, and recover lost belongings , reducing the chaos .
